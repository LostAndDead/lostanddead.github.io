# Creating Hello World

Here I will go over creating an application and showing you different parts of the GUI

### Creating the project

1. From the main menu click the create now project button
   <br/>
   ![Create Project](create-project.png)
   <br/>
   <br/>
2. You will want to find and select this option by either filtering like I did, or searching.
   <br/>
   Once you have selected your project type click `Next`
   <br/>
   ![Select Type](select-type.png)
3. Now name your project `Hello World` (or anything else memorable) and choose where to save it, I recomend leaving this as default. And hit `Create`
   <br/>
   ![Name And Create](name-and-create.png)
4. All done!
   <br/>
   You will have some pre-populated code appear, if you named your project the same as mine then some `Hello World!` code will also apear (A nice little easter egg)
   <br/>
